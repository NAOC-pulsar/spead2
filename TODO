- Rename frozen_heap -> heap, heap -> partial_heap
- Move most of the classes to the detail namespace
- Make receiver align items in immediates the same way as PySPEAD (sender already fixed)
- Add lots of validation to sending (overflows etc)
- Support cancellation of transmission
- Call the send callback with an error if a heap is dropped or the stream is terminated
- Fix PySPEAD's assumption that small items are always immediates
- Ensure that variable-sized items are never sent by immediate
- Investigate memory pools for sender
- Implement more sender classes (particularly vector_stream)
- More send infrastructure (item group, heap numbering etc)
- Change add_item wrapper to automatically extract item ID
- More item validation: value should be a property
- Query for last heap in which an item changed?
- Use eventfd where available for waking up asyncio
- Lots more tests!
- Add udp_reader constructor that takes over a socket
- Add docstrings
- Fix transmit pacing (amortise sleeps)
