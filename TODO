Incompatible interface changes:
  - Move most of the C++ code to the detail namespace

Bug fixes:
  - Distinguish descriptor re-issues from descriptor changes (don't warn on the former)
  - Check that memory alignment requirements for decode_packet are actually respected, particularly in mem_stream
  - Add lots of validation to sending (overflows etc)
  - Error checking in streambuf sender
  - Add test and workaround for endian-swapping within structs (numpy bug https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5356)

Tests:
  - Test binding an illegal UDP port
  - Check that IPv6 works

New features/improvements:
  - Better multicast support (TTL for send, subscribe for receive)
  - Add udp_reader constructor that takes over a socket?
  - Support cancellation of transmission
  - Pass asio send errors into the C++ callback, and from there into Python exceptions
  - Use eventfd where available for waking up asyncio
  - Insert padding into packets between items to keep item payloads naturally aligned?
  - Statistics for memory pool
  - Add default_* and common_defines constants to Python interface
  - Add docstrings to Python extension classes

Other
  - Fix PySPEAD's assumption that small items are always immediates
  - Investigate memory pools for sender
