- Rename frozen_heap -> heap, heap -> live_heap
- Move most of the classes to the detail namespace
- Make receiver align items in immediates the same way as PySPEAD (sender already fixed)
- Add lots of validation to sending (overflows etc)
- Support cancellation of transmission
- Call the send callback with an error if a heap is dropped or the stream is terminated
- Fix PySPEAD's assumption that small items are always immediates
- Investigate memory pools for sender
- Implement more sender classes (particularly vector_stream)
- Python interface to sender
