- recv: Rename frozen_heap -> heap, heap -> partial_heap
- Distinguish descriptor re-issues from descriptor changes (don't warn on the former)
- Move most of the classes to the detail namespace
- Add lots of validation to sending (overflows etc)
- Support cancellation of transmission
- Call the send callback with an error if a heap is dropped or the stream is terminated
- Fix PySPEAD's assumption that small items are always immediates
- Investigate memory pools for sender
- Implement more sender classes (particularly vector_stream)
- More send infrastructure (item group, heap numbering etc)
- More item validation: value should be a property
- Query for last heap in which an item changed?
- Use eventfd where available for waking up asyncio
- Lots more tests!
- Add udp_reader constructor that takes over a socket
- Add docstrings
- Mechanism to send end-of-stream
- Insert padding into packets between items to keep item payloads naturally aligned?
- Check that memory alignment requirements for decode_packet are actually respected, particularly in mem_stream
- Specify full flavour instead of just heap_address_bits
- Make sending (or at least flushing) interruptable
- Make burst size in transmission configurable
- Multicast support (TTL for send, subscribe for receive)
